We will do a cross-platform app in React.
Most of the codebase will be shared, some modules might be coded in Java/Kotlin or Swift/Objective-C if it's necessary.

## IDE
We can use **VS code**, it's lighter and faster than Andoid Studio. Also includes better support for JavaScript and TypeScript (hence for React as well).
For emulation and testing, it's apparently possible through **Expo**
